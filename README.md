# Eulle Stann Casaquite

Welcome to my cartography portfolio! I am a senior student at Augustana College pursuing a degree in Geography, Geology and GIS. Over the past few years, I have developed a strong passion for geospatial analysis and cartography, with a focus on using geospatial data to adress geologic challenges. I wish to continue my academic pursuit and passion by getting admitted to a graduate program that aligns with my goals.
